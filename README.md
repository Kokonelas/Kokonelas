# Hi, I'm Andreas Kokonelis

*Let the code do the talking.*

Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Patras with a strong interest in building clean, functional software. Whether Iâ€™m working on a team project or experimenting with new ideas, I enjoy writing code that solves real problems in thoughtful and efficient ways.

Iâ€™m especially interested in energy systems, intelligent software, and modular architectures â€” and I enjoy learning by building.
